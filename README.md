On the 26th of April, 2018 we knowingly took in [$250,000,000 in investment from Yuri Milner of Digital Sky Technlologies](https://index.co/company/RevolutApp/funding). We knew full well that this money was stolen from the russian people and funded into Yuri Milner's terrorist organization via Putin's state-owned laundromat bank. 

Our founder, Nikolay Storonsky is the sun of GazProm executive  Nikolay Mironovich Storonsky, a Ukrainian traitor who has been helping launder russia's wealth for decades. 

My employers are not doing anything about this except a very weak statement about helping Ukraine. They will not be criticizing Putin or Russia, or ending our business with Russians. 

Well we the engineers of Revolut condem Putin. We condem russia and all of the nazi rashists who support this genocide in Ukraine. 

We do not forget.
We do not forgive. 
We are legion
